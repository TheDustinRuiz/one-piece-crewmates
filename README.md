## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- A challenge arose with nested links, where one link was inadvertently placed inside another, leading to console errors.
- Another challenge involved integrating images from a utility folder into two separate components, requiring careful consideration of file paths and import statements.
- A final challenge emerged from occasional CSS styling inconsistencies, particularly when modifying styles would inadvertently result in the background disappearing.
